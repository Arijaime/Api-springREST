# Api-springREST
technical test challenge

<--How to Use?-->
this API has WAR packaging, which should run on a server that can deploy it.
I recommend using Apache Tomcat v8 +


instructions:
start the server
login with credentials
find and select Api WAR archive and run on port 8080
if it is required to use another port, the file "application.properties"
can be modified
you can see the documentation with Swagger entering localhost: {port} /swagger-ui.html
